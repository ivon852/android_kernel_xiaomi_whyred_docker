SPIDEV

SPI slave devices using the spidev driver allowing for userspace
control of the SPI devices. Must be children of a SPI master node
and contain the following properties.

Required properties:
- compatible:     Should contain:
                  "nxp,mpc57xx" for external CAN controller
                  "infineon,sli97" for external HSM module

- reg:            Chip select address of device.
- spi-max-frequency: Maximum SPI clocking speed of device in Hz.

Optional properties:
- spi-cpol:       Empty property indicating device requires
                  inverse clock polarity (CPOL) mode.
- spi-cpha:       Empty property indicating device requires
                  shifted clock phase (CPHA) mode.

Other optional properties described in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt

Example:

	spi@0 {
		compatible = "nxp,mpc57xx";
		reg = <0>;
		spi-max-frequency = <19200000>;
	};
